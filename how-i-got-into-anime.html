  <h1>How I Got Into Anime</h1>

  <p>
    I still remember the first time I stumbled across anime. I was bored one evening, scrolling through random videos, when I saw a clip from <strong>Naruto</strong>. I didn’t even know what anime was at the time — I just saw a kid with spiky hair screaming about becoming Hokage, and I was instantly hooked.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, I didn’t tell anyone I was watching it. I thought people might laugh or say it’s “just cartoons.” But the more I watched, the more I realized that anime wasn’t just about cool fights or flashy art — it was about emotions, life lessons, motivation, and heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shows like <strong>One Piece</strong> taught me about loyalty and never giving up. <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> made me think deeply about freedom and sacrifice. And <strong>My Hero Academia</strong> gave me the push to keep training in real life — not to become a hero with powers, but to become the best version of myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anime became more than entertainment. It became a part of my life. It helped me through boredom, loneliness, and gave me a reason to dream big.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why I started this blog — to share my love for anime and connect with others who feel the same. Whether you’re just starting or you’ve seen hundreds of shows, you’re welcome here.
